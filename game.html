                            <h3>GAME</h3>

    <p>Game Retail Limited (doing business as GAME) is a British video game retailer, owned by Frasers Group since June 2019.
    The company's origins lie in the founding of the Rhino Group by Terry Norris and Bev Ripley in 1992. 
    A number of mergers and acquisitions followed during the 1990s, and in 1999, the company was purchased by Electronics Boutique Limited, which rebranded itself as The Game Group. 
    The company continued to expand during the 2000s, purchasing several retailers including Gameswizards in Australia.
     In 2007, its parent company purchased its rival store, Gamestation.</P>
